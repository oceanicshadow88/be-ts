### Tech Stack

- Express (Back end web application framework)
- Agenda (Job scheduling)
- Winston (Logging framework)
- Nodemon (Automatically restarts application when code files are updated)
- Loggly (Cloud-based logging solutions)

## TechDebt

See the [open issues](https://010001.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/TEC/boards/2/backlog) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

### Prerequisites

n/a

### Installation

One time command

- docker compose up -d
- cp .env.example .env `(values ask Kitman/team members)`
- yarn build
- yarn setup
- yarn setup-vscode-plugin
- start application (Section below)
- Go to chrome paste this http://localhost:8000/api/v2/healthcheck

### Start application

yarn run dev

### AI Features

The project includes AI-powered text optimization for tickets and comments using Claude AI (Anthropic).

To enable this functionality:

```
# Add to your .env file
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

### Database access

The access database via

- http://localhost:8081/
- Username: admin
- Password: pass

### Folder structure (Devs)

- config: Contains configuration files that store settings and parameters used to customize the behavior of an application.
- controllers: Manages the flow of data between the front end (view) and the back end (services).
- database: Should not be touching this
- emailTemplate: email templates for AWS
- middleware: filter or intermediary in the request-response cycle.
- model: holds the data models of an application, defining the structure, relationships
- routes: Define the various endpoints and paths of a web application, mapping them to the appropriate controller functions for handling requests.
- services: Contains the business logic and data manipulation code.
- types: Typescript types
- utils: helper functions that provide common, reusable functionalities used across different parts of an application.
- validation: process of ensuring that input data meets predefined criteria and is correct, complete, and secure before it's processed or used in an application.
- loader: Stuff that starts the application

## Tests

- npm run test

## Logs

Logs file help developers/devops to address server or code issues when application crashes, you would need to ask email and password from Kitman.

- Local: /storage/logs/logger.log. This file will only generate when there are errors
- Production: https://techscrumapp.loggly.com/search?terms=tag:heroku&from=-20m&until=now&source_group=&newtab=1#terms=tag:*&from=2023-08-12T06:55:41.477Z&until=2023-08-12T07:15:41.477Z&source_group=
